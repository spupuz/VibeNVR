## 2024-05-17 - SSRF Validation Blocking Local Networks
**Vulnerability:** Overly strict SSRF validation blocked private IP addresses.
**Learning:** In NVR systems, webhooks must be able to target private IPs (like 192.168.x.x) for local Home Assistant integrations, so blocking them breaks functionality.
**Prevention:** Use `ip.is_loopback`, `is_unspecified`, `is_link_local`, and `is_multicast` to prevent SSRF against internal host/cloud metadata without breaking local network features.
