## 2024-05-24 - Fix SSRF validation bypass and MitM vulnerability
**Vulnerability:** Webhook SSRF validation failed open. The federation proxy explicitly disabled TLS verification.
**Learning:** Exception handling during validation logic (like `socket.getaddrinfo`) must fail securely (e.g. raise `ValueError`) rather than failing open (`pass` or `return self`).
**Prevention:** In security checks, always default to denial on exception. Avoid global `verify=False` flags in HTTP clients unless absolutely necessary for local untrusted endpoints.
